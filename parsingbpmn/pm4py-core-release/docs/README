This document describes how to generate API documentation using sphinx.

First, install sphinx (we assume you are able to do this via the official sphinx website).

To generate the docs perform the following steps.
	1. First create all the actuall .rst files that define all the documentation.
	In cmd/terminal browse to the docs folder (this folder ;-)) and run:
		> sphinx-apidoc -o source ../
	You can optionally opt to choose to remove all the .rst files from the source folder (except for index.rst!!!!)
	
	2. Generate corresponding html files:
		make html
